---

Native V2Ray deployment: <https://github.com/ygcaicn/v2ray-heroku>

## 0. Attention

Deployment requires registration of a heroku account, a ladder is required when registering a heroku account (otherwise the verification code cannot be brushed out), an email address that can receive verification codes normally (@qq.com, @163.com are not acceptable), gmail is conditional
Best, no conditions recommend outlook <https://login.live.com/> here.

## 1. Verification

After the server is deployed, click open app to display the webpage normally. After the address is filled with the path (for example: <https://test.herokuapp.com/static>), the 404 page is displayed, which means the deployment is successful.

## 2. Client Configuration


QR code address: 

<https://{YOUR-APP}.herokuapp.com/qr/vpn.png>

(Change **YOUR-APP** to your own app name, if you change QR_Path, also change the corresponding qr_img to the modified one)

Use the client to scan the QR code.

**or**

Configuration file address: 

<https://{YOUR-APP}.herokuapp.com/qr/> 

slash '/' is important at last of configuration file address.

Copy after opening and import it on the client.

**or**
